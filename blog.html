                    A variable is undefined when you haven't assigned any value yet, not even a null.
                    A null means the absence of a value. You assign a null to a variable with the intention that
                    currently this variable does not have any value but it will have later on. It is like a placeholder
                    for a value. The type of null is the object. Simply in JavaScript, null is treated as an object.The
                    typeof operator determines the type of variables and values. When the typeof operator is used to
                    determine the undefined value, it returns undefined.

                What do you mean by REST API?

                <p>
                    Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style that defines a set of constraints
                    to be used for creating web services. REST API is a way of accessing web services in a simple and
                    flexible way without having any processing. REST technology is generally preferred to the more
                    robust Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) technology because REST uses less bandwidth, simple and
                    flexible making it more suitable for internet usage. It’s used to fetch or give some information
                    from a web service. All communication done via REST API uses only HTTP request.
